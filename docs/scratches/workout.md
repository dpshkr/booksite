# Workout @ Home

I'm putting this here for anyone else who, like me, is now stuck
inside and/or at home due to the spread of the novel coronavirus and
the ensuing social-distancing.

## How it Works

### Supersets

Every exercise is a superset of the following structure:

1. 10 repetitions --> 15-second rest
2. Repeat 4 times.

!!! tip

    In total, a complete superset should take 5-7 minutes :timer_clock:

The first set should be your warmup set - don't push it too hard on
this one. This set is for getting the blood moving in the movement.

Every set should increase in weight, and the final set should be a
*failure* set.

If you make it to 10 reps on your failure set, that means you increase
your starting weight next time you do this "superset".

### Timed Supersets

In the case of bodyweight workouts such as pushups, the superset
structure is a bit different. For these, completion will be based on
time rather than reps:

1. 30-seconds "on" --> 30-seconds "off"
2. Repeat 4 times.

As you progress throughout the weeks, the "on" round should increase
by 5 seconds each time.

### Rounds

A round is a "superset" followed by an extended rest, i.e.:

1. Superset --> 1-minute Rest

### Workouts

Every workout is comprised of 3-4 "rounds" focusing on the theme of
the day, followed by a "bonus" round which will work a complimentary
muscle group (e.g., shoulders).

Each "round" will be a different exercise.

!!! tip

    A workout should be between 15-20 minutes (including the bonus 
    round) :timer_clock:

## Structuring Your Week

You should aim to do every workout once-per-week. They can be done in
any combination. I recommend the following:

**Day 1:** Chest/Squats  
**Day 2:** Core  
**Day 3:** Biceps  
**Day 4:** Core  
**Day 5:** Triceps/Lunges  
**Day 6:** Core  
**Day 7:** REST

This schedule gives you *at least* 15 minutes of activity a day, with
lighter days in the middle of the week when you're most likely to find
yourself busy or lacking motivation. You also get a short day near the
end of your week as you approach rest day.

Of course, the actual structure of your days is entirely up to you and
your current situation. If you end up front-loading or waiting to the
end of the week, *that's okay* -- just make sure you do it!


## Path to Success

*Write everything down.* I can't stress this enough. Track your
progress on every exercise. Note when/how/why you failed.

*Failure is good.* If you fail to complete a round that means you're
pushing yourself. That means you're going to get better.

*Listen to your body.* You know this already, but I'm putting it down
here. Be careful. Learn your strength and push it patiently.
